Contents:
fasta_f.cpp: this file contains fasta-related management functions that I call in multiple C/C++ programs.
fasta_f.h: the header file for fasta_f.cpp.
bkh-long-var.cpp: a program to sort and output a fasta file containing multiple variants of a gene for the longest variant.
bkh-oDBget.cpp: a program that takes a text file generated by OrthoDB.org that contains cluster ids and creates a url for each cluster id, for downloading with wget.
bkh-gfc.cpp: a program that takes a fasta file and creates a new file for each gene within, or if the gene file already exists, appends them with the genes from the read fasta file. Can read multiple fasta files.
bkh-wgetter.sh: A bash script that uses bkh-oDBget to download a list of cluster ids from orthoDB.org and generate a list of genes associated with those cluster ids.
